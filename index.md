## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/223gMoney/SWEN-GITGUB/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

My name is Huan Huynh, I attended Liverpool High School in Syracuse, New York. 
My favorite hobby is probably playing video games because it's easy to

on campus I've picked up skateboarding and have been trying to practice 
everyday.
