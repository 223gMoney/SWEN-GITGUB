My name is Huan Huynh, I attended Liverpool High School in Syracuse, New York. 
My favorite hobby is probably playing video games because it's easy to 
play any game you want and have fun. Plus you connect with many other people.
I also have been skating a lot recently. With a lot of activities closed
on campus I've picked up skateboarding and have been trying to practice 
everyday.
